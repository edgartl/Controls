# Controls

Sample app from the "Beginning Swift" book.  I've updated the project to use some UIStackViews for Auto Layout.

## Specifics

This project is a sample of controls.  IBOutlets and IBActions are introduced. Keyboard dismissal with resignFirstResponder is handled.  Additionally, UIAlertController is used to present both Alerts and ActionSheets to the user.
